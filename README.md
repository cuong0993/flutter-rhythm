different native apps are in `android` and `ios`.

Extra project assets are in `assets`.

Firebase config files and cloud functions are in the `firebase` folder.

Google Play store listing files are in the `fastlane` folder.

# Prerequisites & Getting Started

To build and run the mobile apps you’ll need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and its dependencies. To verify your installation run in the project’s root directory:**‌**

```
$ flutter doctor
```

## Backend (Firebase)

The backend is build using Firebase’s `node.js` SDK. All files are provided in the `firebase` folder. To deploy the code create an app and install the firebase CLI (See steps 1 & 2 in [Getting started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)).

### B1. Setup sign-in method
An initial sign-in method needs to be configured.

- Select your project in [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).

```
$ firebase deploy --project={projectId}
```

### B4. Synchronize storage 

Install Google Cloud SDK, navigate to the `storage` directory and synchronize storage files using:

```
$ gsutil -m rsync -r -d ./ gs://{projectId}.appspot.com
```

### B4. Synchronize database
