# Pedantic package: The Dart analyzer settings and best practices used internally at Google.
include: package:pedantic/analysis_options.yaml

# Analysis from Flutter stable channel
# https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/stable/packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml

# Specify analysis options.
#
# Until there are meta linter rules, each desired lint must be explicitly enabled.
# See: https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/288
#
# For a list of lints, see: http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/
# See the configuration guide for more

#
# There are four similar analysis options files in the flutter repos:
#   - analysis_options.yaml
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml (this file)
#   - https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by "flutter analyze" and the
# dartanalyzer when analyzing code outside the flutter repository. It isn't named
# 'analysis_options.yaml' because otherwise editors would use it when analyzing
# the flutter tool itself.
#
# When editing, make sure you keep this and /analysis_options.yaml consistent.
